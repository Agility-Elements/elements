# Choice

In the context of Agile, the concept of "choice" refers to the explicit decision points and options that Agile teams have throughout the development process. Some key aspects of choice in the Agile context include:

1. **Explicit Decision Points**: Agile methodologies make important decision points explicit, such as when to accept changes or adjust the project scope. 【1】

2. **Presenting Options and Tradeoffs**: Agile teams are expected to present their options and the associated tradeoffs to stakeholders when making decisions. 【1】

3. **Empowering Teams**: Agile emphasizes empowering teams to make their own choices, rather than having decisions imposed top-down. 【2】【3】

4. **Collaborative Decision-making**: Agile decision-making is a collaborative and consensus-based process involving the entire team. 【2】

5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: The ability to make choices and adapt to changing requirements is a core tenet of Agile, allowing teams to deliver value faster. 【4】【5】

6. **Balancing Priorities**: Agile teams must make choices to balance various priorities, such as scope, quality, and delivery timelines. 【6】【7】

7. **Guiding Principles**: Agile principles and values should guide the choices made by Agile teams, ensuring alignment with the Agile mindset. 【8】

In summary, in the Agile context, "choice" refers to the explicit decision points and options available to Agile teams, which they are empowered to make collaboratively and in alignment with Agile principles, in order to deliver value effectively and adapt to changing requirements. 【1】【2】
