3. **Repeated Appearance or Return**: In the context of something like a symphony, iterative means that a theme or element keeps returning or reappearing in a repeated manner. 【5】

4. **Repeating a Process or Instructions**: Iterative processes involve repeatedly applying a set of instructions or a procedure, each time using the result of the previous iteration as the starting point. 【6】【4】
