Cumulative

 

The idea behind cumulative is that it this the increasing addition of pieces into a larger hole. For example we can make additions repeatedly and then we accumulate more things. So the idea is relatively easy to understand by continually adding to something we can get more of that thing.

 

This assumes that what we have is additive the things we're adding together are additive. And in a lot of areas this isn't true and one of them is in software development. What happens with software is the simple addition of more lines of code does not lead automatically to addition of more functionality or for code to fill its user stories.

 

So this leads us to conclude that the idea of cumulative is a little more deep than we have first thought and that we should pay more attention to it. So what we're really looking at there is we need to think about what we are accumulating to make sure it is additive. And also we need to understand that what we are being asked to do is in itself additive and leads to cumulative behavior. 

 

Now reading the previous paragraph you probably realized that's what you want with user stories. You want the user stories to be cumulative. You want the smaller user stories to be additive so that they build up to a larger user story and a usage scenario. And that's the story behind cumulative.
