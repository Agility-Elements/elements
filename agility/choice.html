<p>The idea of having choices is that you have some degree of discretion over what you do period. So it’s possible for example, to look at the, your context of work you doing and then decide the best approach to do that work, which is one of the basic ideas of agile.</p>
<p>When we take that away, then we were eliminating choice. Not necessarily about thing because we might be using standardization for example, to maintain a level of performance and choices, not appropriate at that point because the performance has to be maintained. So, we don’t want to exercise choices, which might compromise that performance In reality, that doesn’t really work that much of that wealth for software development.</p>
<p>For example, the work is complex and how the people undertaken the worker faced with a myriad of choices. So, they really do need to be allowed to exercise his, a degree of discretion. And as we see with our job practices, the technique is to specify the end result and let the team of people work towards that result in any way that they feel is most appropriate.</p>
