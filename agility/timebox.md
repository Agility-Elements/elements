# Timebox

In the context of Agile, a "timebox" is defined as:

1. **A fixed period of time**: A timebox is a pre-determined, fixed duration of time, usually ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. 【1】【2】

2. **With a specific objective**: The goal is to complete one or more objectives within the allotted timebox. These objectives are usually the delivery of working software or other valuable output. 【1】【2】

3. **Part of Agile iterations**: In Agile methodologies like Scrum, these timeboxes are commonly referred to as "iterations" or "sprints". 【3】【4】

4. **Promotes focus and efficiency**: Timeboxing helps teams stay focused and work efficiently by limiting the scope of work to what can be completed within the fixed duration. 【5】【6】

5. **Enables flexibility and adaptation**: Timeboxes allow Agile teams to be responsive to changing requirements and priorities, as the scope can be adjusted within each timebox. 【2】【6】

In summary, in the context of Agile, a timebox is a pre-determined, fixed period of time during which a team works to complete a specific set of objectives, usually in the form of working software or other valuable deliverables. Timeboxing is a core practice that helps Agile teams stay focused, efficient, and adaptable. 【7】【5】
