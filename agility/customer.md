# Customer

1. **The primary stakeholder**: The customer is the primary stakeholder who has the best knowledge about the product and its requirements. 【1】

2. **Part of the Scrum team**: The customer is an active member of the Scrum team, participating in activities like defining requirements, providing feedback, and guiding the technical roadmap. 【2】【3】

3. **Collaborator**: Agile emphasizes "Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation", highlighting the importance of working closely with the customer to understand and meet their needs. 【4】【5】

4. **Beneficiary of value**: Customers are the ultimate beneficiaries of the value created by the Agile team's solutions. 【6】

5. **Contributor to Agility**: As part of the Agile ecosystem, the customer is expected to contribute the same level of Agility, thought, and work as the development team. 【7】

6. **Distinct from the product owner**: While the product owner represents the customer's interests, the customer is a broader term that may include end-users, stakeholders, and other decision-makers. 【8】

In summary, in the Agile context, the customer is a key member of the Scrum team who collaborates closely with the development team, provides feedback, and ensures that the delivered value meets their needs. 【9】【5】
