Based on the available information, in the context of Agile, "spectral thinking" refers to the concept of viewing Agile as a spectrum or continuum, rather than a binary state of being "Agile" or "not Agile". Some key aspects of spectral thinking in the Agile context include:

1. **Agile is a Broad Spectrum**: The information suggests that "Agile is a broad church" and includes a wide range of tools, techniques, and approaches. 【1】

2. **Balancing Theory and Reality**: Effectively implementing Agile requires striking the right balance between Agile theory and the practical realities of an organization. 【2】

3. **Exploring Paths to Progress**: Spectral thinking is described as a "tool to explore paths to progress" and break out of limiting mindsets. 【3】

4. **Agility as a Spectrum**: Agility is not an absolute state, but rather a spectrum where teams can be more or less agile depending on their practices and capabilities. 【4】

5. **Agile Transformation as a Spectrum**: The process of transforming an organization to be more Agile is also viewed as a spectrum, rather than a binary outcome. 【5】

6. **Avoiding Absolutes**: Spectral thinking encourages avoiding absolutes and binary thinking about Agile, recognizing the nuances and complexities involved. 【6】【7】

In summary, in the Agile context, "spectral thinking" refers to the concept of viewing Agile as a spectrum or continuum, where organizations and teams can exhibit varying degrees of Agility based on their practices, mindsets, and the balance they strike between Agile theory and practical realities. 【8】【9】
