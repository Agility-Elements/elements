# Rewarding

In the context of Agile, "rewarding" refers to the practices and approaches used to recognize, motivate, and incentivize Agile teams and individuals. Some key aspects of rewarding in the Agile context include:

1. **Aligning with Agile Principles**: Agile reward systems should be designed to reinforce the Agile values and principles, such as collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. 【1】【2】

2. **Team-based Rewards**: Agile emphasizes team-based work, so rewards should often be given to the entire team rather than individuals, to promote collective ownership and collaboration. 【1】【2】

3. **Knowledge-based Rewards**: Providing opportunities for team members to gain new knowledge, such as sending them to conferences or training, is considered a valuable reward in Agile. 【3】

4. **Flexible and Responsive**: Agile reward systems should be flexible and responsive to changing needs and priorities, rather than rigid, annual processes. 【4】【5】

5. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Agile reward systems should focus on intrinsic motivators, such as autonomy, mastery, and purpose, rather than solely relying on extrinsic rewards like financial bonuses. 【6】【7】

6. **Avoiding Individual-based Rewards**: Rewarding individual contributions can undermine the collaborative nature of Agile and should be avoided. 【2】

In summary, in the Agile context, rewarding refers to the practices and approaches used to recognize, motivate, and incentivize Agile teams and individuals in a way that aligns with Agile principles and promotes the desired behaviors, such as collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. 【4】【8】
