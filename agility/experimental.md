Being experimental means that we are in the process of forming a hypothesis and then we are going to test our hypothesis to see whether it's supported by observation ull data. This implies for example that we have control over the environment that the experiments running in and that we were able to make influences in those areas.

That may or may not be true we need to determine that some extent which in of itself could be an experiment.

So what we end up with is some careful structuring of experiments with all the expected precautions around running them we have to make sure that we have control variables we have to make sure that we have independence of our experimental variables and we have to be diligent in setting up our experiments and executing them so that we have done it methodically and we have been diligently so that the efficacy of the experiment isn't in doubt and we have to be thorough in the collection of our results.

We also have to remind ourselves that in fact we have to be careful in interpreting our results and they might be open to different interpretation.

This leads to having a greater degree of transparency because our results might be open to question and we want others to be able to provide differing perspectives and points of view on those results so that we can have different interpretations into much healthier ecosystem to work in.

All of this does depend on the fact that we are in a position to form different hypothesis and typically this is done by asking questions. So questions then take a centre stage in being experimental we are driving our behavior and our work through questions so the questions drive what we do.
