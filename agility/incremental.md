# Incremental

## Execute in small steps

Being incremental means we're going to be doing things in small steps. 

## Consider the result of each increment

At the end of each increment we can reflect on how we executed our increment and the results we achieved. 

## Adapt

Combining increments with a consideration of how we are executing our work gives us a way to adapt our approach and mitigate risks.

## Deliver Value

We can arrange our work so that each increment delivers value.

## Value can accumulate

Ideally the result of each increment is cumulative; so our latest increment builds on our previous increment.
